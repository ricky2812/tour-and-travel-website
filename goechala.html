                        <p> <strong>Day 1: New Jalpaiguri (NJP) to Yuksom </strong></p>
                        <p> <b> Trekking in Sikkim </b> the beautiful journey for Goechala begins from New Jalpaiguri Station where our representative will cordially welcome you at around 10am. The schedule for the day includes a long drive to Yuksom which is about 150kms away and takes about 8 hours to drive, if the road congestion is minimal. So, after the meeting itâ€™s an immediate start for the destination. Yuksom is one of the historical towns of Sikkim which provides enough glimpses of the rich heritage and religious traditions, so prominent of the state. Being once the capital of the state, Yuksom poses to have multiple attractions in terms of culture, community and peaceful serene environment that exceed the expectation of every traveller.<br />
                        On the way from New Jalpaiguri to Yuksom, there are two official paper works that needs to be done to fetch the necessary permission for the hiking trip. The first one is to take due permission from the police station based at Melli to ensure that official records are kept of the trekking expedition and to also have safety along the way. The paperwork includes filling up basic informations and providing two passport size photographs which needs to be affixed in the form. For the foreign nationals the rules are little different and they need to collect ILP or Inner Line Permit to continue the journey. However the travellers need not worry about the same as the drivers will help fetching it but it will take not less than half an hour to complete the formalities. After conducting the official works it's a straight drive crossing Melli which is based at the border of Melli and West Bengal. The next stop would be at Jorthang where the travellers can have the lunch break, enjoying the delicious food of the north eastern region. After lunch itâ€™s a continue trip to Yuksom, so that the place can be reached by early evening. For the travellers who wish to dispense money, the last ATM counter falls at Legship. On reaching Yuksom, the hikers will soon be accommodated in the guest house where they can have rest and relax for the rest of the day. Around late evening the tour guide will give a small briefing of the tour and help understand the trekking route, the rules of the trek, the environmental conditions that may be present and the essential commodities which should be carried along. Any physical ailment of any kind should be communicated to the tour Instructor. Yuksom also is the last destination where the travellers can think of final pick up of small eateries or other provisions that may be required in the trek. There are plenty of shops in the town where hikers can fulfil their requirements. <br /><br />
                        â€¢	As per the Sikkim government, foreigners(including OCI, NRI) need to obtain a special permit to trek in Sikkim. This permit is issued in Gangtok and therefore, foreigners need to come one day before in Yuksom. This process requires your signed ILP, therefore it cannot be processed in advance and can be processed only when you enter Sikkim. The charges of obtaining the permit will be Rs.2, 000 per person. TTH will cooperate with you in getting the permit. You have to pay this amount to our representative and we shall get the permit, once you have arrived. Please make a note that your expenses for the additional day are not included in our costs. <br /> <br />
                        â€¢	Citizens of China, Myanmar, and Bangladesh are not permitted to trek in Sikkim.

The total distance from Yuksom to Sachen is about 8kms and takes approximately 6 hours to reach the destination. Though many tour operators believe in travelling till Tshoka in one go, but it can be quite tiring and the enjoyment of the trek could be lost with too much physical exhaustion. In this trail one can find absolutely no shops and even the telecom network gets quite erratic as the elevation increases. Packed lunch should be carried since itâ€™s a long day. The beautiful trail starts with sights of fascinating small huts as the travellerâ€™s move forward leaving the villages behind. Enjoying the fresh air the trail continues crossing the vast landscapes and soon the trail lands to the valley of the serene River Rathong. <br />
                        Crossing the valley, the trekking trail takes a sharp turn to the forested lands which with each step becomes denser with thick growth of trees. After sometime, the travellers may feel difficulty since sunlight only peeks in few deserted areas but the rest of the trail through the deep tropical forest of oak, fir, bamboo and pine trees making the route quite dark. Many hikers use torches in this place to have a clear vision since the trail often remains congested with mountain yaks and mules. It is advisable to give way to the animals and stay close to the mountains. Trekking through the forest for around 30 mins, the trekkers ca reach the first bridge which is actually in absolute darkness except some occasional sunlight. Continuing on the trail the trekkers moves forward to experience the spectacular beauty of Tshushay Khola waterfalls which again flows to meet the Perk River and then crosses the second iron bridge.

As soon as this 3rd or the last bridge of the day is reached, one can be assure that the altitude of 7100 feet is conquered. From here itâ€™s another 20 minutes trekking to the campsite zone. Since it is a forested area, tents are set for sleeping for the night.<br />
                        It can be quite an exhausting day so it better to sleep early listening to the gushing waters of Perk River.

The trail to Lamuney is quite decent though close to campsite the trekkers get a hard time with the steep rocky climb to move forward. On reaching Lamuney, hikers can cherish the hot lunch and relax in the fascinating ambiance. For the enthusiasts however, there remains more adventure to explore. At a distance of nearly 2 kms from the campsite lies the beautiful Samiti Lake waiting to be explored.

                        After leaving the campsite itâ€™s a known trail to begin with, towards Samiti Lake, which takes about an hour to reach. From here itâ€™s a steep ascent towards Goechala view point which is based at an elevation of 15,100 feet, at a distance of about 5kms from Lamuney. Usually it takes about 3 hours to climb the point but it entirely depends on the speed of the trekkers.

The beautiful sunrise in these awe striking snowy mountains is simply captivating.

On reaching the campsite at Lamuney cherish a hot lunch and pack the belongings for a further descend to the next campsite at Thansing or Kokcharang. It is better to descend as much as possible in the same day before opting for the campsite. However on reaching Thansing, it can be called a day with a good night sleep at the tents.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p><strong>Day 9: Thansing/Kokcharang to Tsokha via Phedang</strong></p>
                        <p>The next day of the trek is set for descending from Thansing at 12,900 feet to Tsokha at 9700 feet. The total distance for the trek down is 16kms and it takes about approximately 7 hours to cover the distance. The journey for the day starts nearly at 7 am so that the destination for the day can be reached by latest 3 to 4 pm. Packed lunch should be carried along to avoid camping for long in the afternoon. The first destination is Phedang which takes about 4 to 5 hours to reach. The trail back is quite interesting and direct without much diversions crossing Dzongri. Moving from one mountain to another the trail moves on towards the rhododendron forest which needs to be crossed to descend further. The environment here is quite fascinating as the rich forest vibrates enthusiasm and renewed energy. The pathway is quiet simple with not much difficulty and no steep stretches which also helps in conducting a pleasant journey. The most astounding view in this trail is the sight of Mount Pandim with its snow clad peak jutting out and glorifying the trail. Though its only 5 hours journey to Phedang, it can be quite tiring and that is why itâ€™s better to take some rest reaching Phedang. There are plenty of temporary camping sites where trekkers can sit and have their packed lunch in soothing atmosphere. The cool breeze of the mountainous region is quite comforting that refreshes the mind. One can take time to have some snaps here and enjoy the rich ambience. After having the desired rest time, the trek continues towards Tsokha through the same trail through which the earlier journey was conducted. The distance from Phedang to Tshoka is about 5 kms. The trail as described earlier moves through forested lands and rich outgrow of flora and fauna which is not much difficult terrain specially while descending. However it is better to avoid too many breaks on the way to reach Tsokha way before dark time.

                        <p><strong>Day 10: Tsokha to Yuksom via Bakhim and Sachen </strong></p>
                        <p>The targeted destination for the day is Yuksom which was the commencing point of the trek at 5,670 feet. It is a long 15kms trekking distance and the ideal time to cover the same is approximately 7 hours. The day starts early as usual breathing in fresh air and commencing with revived energy for a long day. Packed lunch is carried along to lessen the break time on the way down. The trail for coming down is absolutely the same which was taken while ascending towards Goechala. Enjoying the view of the snow clapped Himalayas this is a pleasant trail filled with natural extravaganza. The road as described earlier is devoid of steep turns which also make the journey less tiresome and more pleasurable. Just as mentioned above, the trail passes through prominent destinations of Bakhim and Sachen, before moving forward to the three iron bridges and finally moves towards Yuksom. From Sachen the road is not that favourable considering the zig zag format and continuous up and down losing altitude. Hillock climbs categorises the final destinations of the trail. Though it can be quite strenuous after a long day of physical exhaustion, but the best part is, it is only a few meters. After crossing the hillocks, the trekkers finally reach the beautiful Yuksom neighbourhood. Just before reaching the town the telecom network returns which help the travellers to quickly get in touch with family and friends to assure well being. However overlooking hilly villages and small establishments itâ€™s a pleasant come back to the Yuksom town.

The journey back is also equally scenic and pleasant with the view of the Himalayas at the distance which makes it quite a pleasure ride. Lunch can be enjoyed at Jorthang where there are several eateries serving good chinese, Indian, continental and local foods. After enjoying lunch start at the earliest to reach the station way before designated time. Since the travel time is not fixed, it is always suggested to the travellers to book an onward journey from New Jalpaiguri Station at late hours.
