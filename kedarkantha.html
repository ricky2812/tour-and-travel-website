The journey is a long one and takes about evening to reach the destination. In the midst one can enjoy the lunch break at the popular eateries having some local food and homemade spices. The last 22 kms to Sankri is all the more exciting since it travels through Govind National Park which is famous for its avid collection of flora typical of this region and not found in any other location of the country. The expected time to reach Sankri is 5 pm but since in some areas the roads are a little bumpy and rough, the time can be a little longer.

Having an early start after a healthy breakfast at the hotel it’s a journey straight towards Juda Ka Talab which is based at an altitude of 9100 feet. It’s a 4km trekking journey and the approximate time for reaching the same is around 5 hours. The journey begins by moving out of Sankri village through an extension called Sor. Once the village is crossed the road takes a wide curve and climbs sharply. Moving along the stream this is the road that moves towards the Kedarkantha. The initial climb would be climbing several bridges through dense forest trees and thick carpet of maple and pine leaves all brown in color. It’s an exquisite vision and a pictorial view that leaves all mesmerized. The trail is wide and one can hear the sounds of running streams all through but may not be in view till much further. On the way one can view remote villages where women and kids are found carrying bundles of wooden logs, wooden sticks and dry leaves to utilize them for household cooking and setting up night fire. While crunching the dried maple and oak leaves on the way up one can also view Himalayan Languars swinging from one branch of trees to another. Though they are somewhat a shy animal it’s difficult to have a gallant view of them as they move quickly from the vision’s range. Apart from this, boars, martens and hares can also be spotted in this region. The scenario however changes a lot in the summer months when the luscious meadows remain verdant green with hilly flowers of unique kind. Crossing few streams and continuing through the trail and rising sharp through dense oaks one can reach the beautiful pictorial spot of Jadu Ka Talab which can never be missed by any trekker due to its sharp contrasting and unique beauty. </p>
